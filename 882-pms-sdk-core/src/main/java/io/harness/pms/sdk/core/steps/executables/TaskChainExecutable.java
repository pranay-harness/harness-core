/**
 * Use this interface when you want to execute multiple tasks in a chain inside a single node
 *
 * Example: We want to perform multiple HttpRequests in a single Node
 * 1. HttpChain: Parameters: [http1Params, http2Params, http3Params,. http4Params]
 * 2. Clone a manifest and apply certain operation on the same [GitCloneTask, K8sTask]
 *
 *
 * Interface Details
 *
 * startChainLink : The execution for this step start with this method. It expects as childNodeId in the response
 * based on which we spawn the child. If you set the chain end flag to true in the response we will straight away call
 * finalize execution else we will call executeNextChild. You can add a {@link PassThroughData} in the response which
 * will be passed on to the next method
 *
 * executeNextChild : This is the the repetitive link which is repetitively called until the chainEnd boolean is set in
 * the response.
 *
 * finalizeExecution : This is where the step concludes and responds with step response.
 *
