<!--
    Checkstyle configuration that checks the Harness coding style.

    Harness uses clang-format for checking indentation and code organization enforced with other means.
    There is no point of duplicating this effort with providing checks from here.

    There are many reasons a particular code style to be enforced.
    There are few though that make a lot of practical sense. Lets limit this file to those:

    1. Good practices preventing errors or error prone code.
    2. Consistency for thing that make no sense to involve innovative approach ... or are so simple to
       follow, there are no reason not to. After some initial learning curve those should be saving time.

    The most important aspect of these checks is to never ever do style comment in a code review, which is
    pointlessly time consuming and contributes to demoralization of both sides involved in it.

    If a style requirement cannot be expressed with this configuration it is probably not worth having.

    If you would like to add new rule or improve a current one, please make sure that you resolve all the
    preexisting issues. If you cannot find to do so, it is probably not worth having it.
