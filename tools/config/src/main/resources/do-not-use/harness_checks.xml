    Checkstyle module configuration for Harness coding style.

    Harness uses clang-format for checking for indentation and similar code organization.
    Checkstyle does not duplicate this effort but provides additional checks that clang-format
    is incapable to enforce.

    Enforcing code style is a controversial topic and as many benefits it offers if overdone it
    might have negative effect on moral and performance. The rules to follow should be evaluated
    for ROI and should be committed to only after thorough consideration. The following are the
    major factor for check to be enforced:

    1. Good practices preventing errors or error prone code - there are checks that could identify
       code written in a way that has proven error prone outcome. Either for the person writhing the
       code or for the reader.
    2. Consistency in expressing statements with the same meaning - innovation is a big part of
       what we do as software engineers. It has to have the right place. More routine and templatized
       the simple patterns in the code are, less energy is spend to write and read the code. This
       will allow for innovation where it belongs - creating features that excite the customers.

    The purpose of these checks is minimize the amount of work is put into the code review process
    on both sides - producer and reviewer.

    This tool has for goal to eliminates the need of code style paper. It is under constant development.
    If there is a style that you find important for the team to follow, you should start from trying to
    implement check for it.
